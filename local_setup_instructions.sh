# How to install the FarmBot Web App on a local machine

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Resources are limited and FarmBot Inc cannot provide
# longterm support to self-hosted users. If you have never administered a
# Ruby on Rails/Javascript application, we highly advise stopping now. This
# presents an extremely high risk of data loss. Free hosting is provided at
# https://my.farm.bot and eliminates the risks and troubles of self-hosting.
# Self-hosting a FarmBot server is not a simple task!

# Install docker and docker compose
# =================================
# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg -y
source /etc/os-release
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$ID/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/$ID $VERSION_CODENAME stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y

# Mac:
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
# Open the Docker Desktop app
# Install docker-compose
brew install docker-compose

#####################################################################
# From here on out, all commands are the same for both Linux and Mac,
# but `sudo` is not required for Mac.

# Verify docker installation
# ==========================
sudo docker run hello-world
sudo docker compose version

# Clone the FarmBot Web App repository
# ====================================
# âš  SKIP THIS STEP IF UPGRADING!
git clone https://github.com/FarmBot/Farmbot-Web-App --depth=5 --branch=main
# Change directory to the project
cd Farmbot-Web-App

# Set your ENVs
# =============
# âš  SKIP THIS IF UPGRADING!
cp example.env .env
# Open `.env` in a text editor and change all the values.
# âš  SKIP THIS STEP IF UPGRADING!
nano .env

# Install project dependencies
# ============================
# Install the correct version of bundler for the project
sudo docker compose run web gem install bundler
# Install application specific Ruby dependencies
sudo docker compose run web bundle install
# Install application specific Javascript deps
sudo docker compose run web npm install
# Create a database in PostgreSQL
sudo docker compose run web bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate
# Generate a set of *.pem files for data encryption
# âš  SKIP THIS STEP IF UPGRADING!
sudo docker compose run web rake keys:generate

# Run the server! ðŸŒ±
# ==================
# Note: You won't be able to log in until you see a message similar to this:
#   "âœ¨  Built in 44.92s"
# You will just get an empty screen otherwise.
# This only happens during initialization and may take a long time on slow machines.
sudo docker compose up
# If you get an MQTT authentication error, it could be a config file issue.
# Verify that you've used your computer's real IP address
# (`hostname -I` on Linux or `ipconfig getifaddr en0` on Mac)
# for the values of `API_HOST` and `MQTT_HOST` in the `.env` file, and then:
# Stop the server with `Ctrl + C` and
sudo docker compose down
# Start the server again with
sudo docker compose up
# At this point, setup is complete.
# Content should be visible at http://API_HOST:3000/.

# Verify installation (optional)
# ==============================
# You can optionally verify installation by running unit tests.
# Create the database for the app to use
sudo docker compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test web bundle exec rails db:setup
# Run the tests in the "test" RAILS_ENV
sudo docker compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test web rspec spec
# Run user-interface unit tests (requires a large amount of RAM)
sudo docker compose run web npm run test


# === BEGIN OPTIONAL UPGRADES to later versions of the FarmBot Web App ===
  # Shut down the server
  sudo docker compose down
  # Start the database service by starting the web container
  sudo docker compose run web gem install bundler
  # Verify that the correct database service is running.
  # If the version doesn't print, a `git reset` may be required.
  sudo docker compose exec db pg_dumpall -V
  # Create a database backup (this will overwrite dump.sql!)
  # If you do not do this before `git pull`, you will need to `git reset` first.
  sudo docker compose exec db pg_dumpall -U postgres > dump.sql
  # Create a backup of the dump.sql file. This will be gitignored
  # or stashed in the next step to not interfere with the git pull later.
  cp -vi dump.sql dump_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).sql
  # Stage and stash to avoid conflicts with the `git pull`. Stage:
  git add .
  # And stash. Any output from this command is fine.
  git stash save "pre-upgrade"
  # Shut down the server again to stop the database service
  sudo docker compose down
  # Stop and remove containers
  sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -aq --filter name=farmbot)
  sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aq --filter name=farmbot)
  # Remove docker images. This will later require re-download of large amounts of data.
  sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -q --filter reference=farmbot*)
  sudo docker system prune -af --filter label=farmbot
  # Delete the database. This will delete all of your data!
  # Only run after verifying your data is backed up in dump.sql.
  # Commented with `#` for safety. Run the command without `#`.
  # sudo rm -rf docker_volumes
  # If your system is a fresh machine that is only used as a farmbot server,
  # you can run these commands to delete all docker data.
  # sudo docker system prune -af --volumes
  # sudo docker volume rm $(sudo docker volume ls -q)
  # Verify that the database has been deleted. Do not continue on until "OK".
  if [ -d docker_volumes/db ]; then echo "ERROR"; else echo "OK"; fi
  # Delete the parcel cache
  sudo rm -rf .parcel-cache/
  # Remove installed NPM packages
  sudo rm -rf node_modules/
  # Download the latest version of the web app
  git pull https://github.com/FarmBot/Farmbot-Web-App.git main
  # Install Ruby gems
  sudo docker compose run web gem install bundler
  sudo docker compose run web bundle install
  # Install NPM packages
  sudo docker compose run web npm install
  # Edit the `dump.sql` file to replace the PASSWORD value at the end of line 15
  # with the value of POSTGRES_PASSWORD from .env
  nano dump.sql
  # Verify that the correct database service is running
  sudo docker compose exec db pg_dumpall -V
  # Restore the database
  sudo docker compose run -v $(pwd):/farmbot db bash
  # Run these commands in the db container shell opened by the previous command
  # --- begin db container shell commands ---
  cd /farmbot
  PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql -U postgres -h db < dump.sql
  exit
  # --- end db container shell commands ---
  # Migrate the database
  sudo docker compose run web rails db:migrate
  # Verify that parcel builds successfully
  sudo docker compose run web rake assets:precompile
  # Run the server
  sudo docker compose up
