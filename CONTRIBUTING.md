# TODO

## UX
* find strings that aren't picked up by the language helper
* find elements that don't have a `title` to help users understand what the button does

## Code refactoring and documentation
* search for `// eslint-disable-next-line` and typecasts

    some may be fixable with refactoring, while others may be:
    * for testing purposes
    * for readability or code understandability
    * due to broken dependency typings
* refactor CSS
* write tests for untested code and refactor unnecessary branches
* find confusing or unclear functions or code that could benefit from documentation
* find outdated comments and typos in documentation
* update this document with additional areas of maintenance concern
